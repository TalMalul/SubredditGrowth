# Project Repository - README

Welcome to our project repository! This repository contains the code and resources for our project that involves analyzing Reddit data using various scripts and tools. Unfortunately, due to the large size of the data, we are unable to upload it directly to this repository. However, we have provided a link to a shared drive where you can access the data folder.

**Data Link:** [Shared Drive - Data Folder]([[link-to-your-shared-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nm5clHN4_aVKseSaNxP8u6N_Ufjz5c_1?usp=sharing)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nm5clHN4_aVKseSaNxP8u6N_Ufjz5c_1?usp=sharing))

## Team Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort between two team members: Tal and Hila. Here's a breakdown of how we divided the work:

### Tal's Contributions:
1. Tal ran the script responsible for fetching data from the Reddit API on the cluster. This script was developed by Hila.
2. Tal also wrote the script to gather data from redditstat.com and implemented the main model.

### Hila's Contributions:
1. Hila authored the notebook used to extract data from the Reddit API.
2. She worked on processing and analyzing the (limited) data obtained from the Reddit API, focusing on creating networks and visualizing them.

## Integration of Chat-GPT

In addition to our manual coding efforts, we leveraged the power of Chat-GPT to assist us in writing portions of the code and formalizing our English throughout the project.

We hope that this repository provides insights into our project's workflow and the collaborative nature of our work. Feel free to explore the code, scripts, and resources provided. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for your interest!

Best regards,
Tal & Hila
